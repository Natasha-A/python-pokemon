# Python Pokemon
 Pokemon Game Based off of Turn-Based Battles. Player battles with CPU in a series of rounds where a pokemon is chosen and different attacks can be chosen yielding in different amounts of damage or healing health. Whoever is able to cause one the opponent's pokemon to faint first, wins the the battle.

 ## Objective
 Practice OOP with Python, and expertly use event driven application development and algorithm capabilities of Python.

## GUI Extension
As a part of extended research and understanding of application development, I decided to create an intro GUI interface.
Working with Tkinter offers many benefits since it's framework is very expansive and flexible to work with. Coupled trial/error and investigating through documentation I was able to create a interface despite my limited experience with Finite State Machines at the time.

## Revealed Aspects 

```- REVEALED ASPECTS -
Attack Damage Outcomes
- First Attack: Yields in damage by 10 - 25 HP
- Second Attack: Yields in damage by 18 - 35 HP
- Third Attack: Yields in healing (to own pokemon) by 10 - 25 HP

Type Advantages: Stronger Pokemon - increase attack damage by half; Weaker Pokemon - decreases attack by half
- FIRE pokemon is STRONGER against GRASS pokemon
- FIRE pokemon is WEAKER against WATER pokemon

- WATER pokemon is STRONGER against FIRE pokemon
- WATER pokemon is WEAKER against GRASS pokemon

- GRASS pokemon is STRONGER against WATER pokemon
- GRASS pokemon is WEAKER against FIRE pokemon
